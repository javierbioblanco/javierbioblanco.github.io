		<h1>Hola :parrot:</h1>
		<p>I am a Mexican computational biologist specializing in ancestry deconvolution analyses and applications of machine learning to genetic data. Under the supervision of Dr. Marcus Feldman, I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Biology from Stanford University, and have published research in human population genetics in Nature, one of the leading journals in the field. My recent projects focus on the human settlement of the Polynesia while leveraging local ancestry in genome-wide association studies, and in conducting analyses of human genetic, epigenetic, environmental and cultural variation to quantify the importance of gene-culture coevolution as a force for recent human evolution.</p>
