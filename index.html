		<h3>Hola qu√© tal :)</h3>
		<p> I'm a PhD candidate at Stanford University working under the supervision of <b>Prof. Marcus Feldman</b> and <b>Prof. Alexander Ioannidis</b>. Funded by <b>Stanford's Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship (SIGF)</b>, I currently aim to:</p>
		<p> <b> Aim 1.To expand upon the historical analysis of Polynesian settlement patterns, incorporating these insights into the advancement of precision medicine strategies tailored to understudied admixed minority populations. </b></p>
		<p> <b> Aim 2 To extend the study of gene-culture coevolution, using ancestry-specific methodologies to enhance the understanding of genetic, cultural, and ecological interactions. This work, deeply rooted in a mathematical understanding of evolutionary genetics, leverages high-dimensional datasets across diverse fields to illuminate the dynamic relationships between genes and culture. The developed methods can potentially quantify the impact of social learning and cultural evolution across a variety of species, leading to a deeper understanding of how anthropogenic changes drive evolution.</b></p>
		<p> <b> Aim 3 To understand the evolution of creole languages by borrowing techniques from population genetics. By comparing the genetic ancestry-specific patterns with linguistic and cultural patterns within 'admixed' languages, I aim to identify subsets of linguistic or cultural features commonly inherited. This unique, data-driven approach can help unravel historical narratives for populations like New Zealand's Maori, even when genetic data is absent, offering a significant contribution to our understanding of human cultural and linguistic evolution.</b></p>
